- Datasets: [XOR, MM(1k), MNIST] training + validation

- Models: [WIDE 1-layer MLP, NARROW 1-layer MLP]
- Methods: [SGD, Gibbs, HMC]
- Metrics: [Accuracy, loss] by epoch
- Loss is the cross-entropy between predictions and labels, which is different from our HMC loss function used in training.
- Optimizer: Adam(lr)
